This is a package for [CERK](https://github.com/ce-rust/cerk).
CERK is an open source [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) Router written in Rust with a MicroKernel architecture.

## Introduction

CERK lets you route your [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) between different different ports.
Ports are transport layer bindings over which CloudEvents can be exchanged.
It is built with modularity and portability in mind.

## Components

CERK comes with a couple of prefabricated components, but implementing custom components is easy.

A good overview is provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/ce-rust/cerk/).

### This Component: The MicroKernel

The MicroKernel is responsible for starting the other components with the help of the Scheduler and brokering messages between them.

The MicroKernel is implemented in this crate.
